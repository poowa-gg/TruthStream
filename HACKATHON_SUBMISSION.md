# TruthStream - XION Proof of Concept Hackathon Submission

## Project Information

**Project Name:** TruthStream  
**Team:** Solo Developer  
**Submission Date:** January 2025  
**Category:** All Tracks (Virality & Competitions, Marketplaces, Verification Gating)

## Project Description

TruthStream is a decentralized content authenticity marketplace that verifies and monetizes real-world experiences through multi-source data validation. Users create verifiable "Experience NFTs" by combining multiple data sources to prove authentic real-world activities, then monetize them through a trust-based marketplace.

### Key Innovation
- **Multi-Modal Verification**: Combines location, payment, social media, and biometric data
- **Experience NFTs**: Immutable proof of authentic experiences on XION blockchain  
- **Trust-Based Economy**: Monetization layer that rewards authentic behavior
- **zkTLS Integration**: Privacy-preserving verification without exposing raw data

## Problem Statement Alignment

**Problem:** Fake reviews, staged content, and AI-generated media erode trust online. Content creators can't prove authenticity, consumers can't distinguish genuine recommendations, and brands waste money on fake engagement.

**Solution:** TruthStream creates verifiable proof of authentic experiences using XION's technology stack, enabling users to monetize their authenticity while brands can target genuinely experienced customers.

## Technical Implementation

### XION Integration
- ✅ **Mobile Development Kit (Dave)**: Native iOS/Android app built with React Native
- ✅ **zkTLS**: Verifies data from payment processors, social media, location services
- ✅ **On-chain Source of Truth**: Smart contracts store verification hashes and reputation scores
- ✅ **XION Testnet**: Deployed and functional on XION testnet

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with XION Dave Mobile SDK
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: XION Testnet with custom smart contracts
- **Verification**: zkTLS for multi-source data validation
- **Storage**: IPFS for metadata, MongoDB for user data

### Smart Contracts
1. **TruthStreamNFT.sol**: ERC721 contract for Experience NFTs
2. **TruthStreamToken.sol**: ERC20 token for rewards and marketplace
